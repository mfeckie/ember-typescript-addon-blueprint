# Ember TypeScript Addon Blueprint

Finding information on how to write an ember-cli addon in TypeScript has proven to be challenging. There's a clear path to writing Ember addons using TypeScript, but not so much for extensions to the CLI itself.

This Blueprint aims to provide a minimal template for creating extensions to Ember-CLI using TypeScript for authoring.

## Usage

Create an addon with this template

`ember addon -b https://github.com/mfeckie/ember-typescript-addon-blueprint.git {your_addon_name}`

Use with yarn for package management

`ember addon -b https://github.com/mfeckie/ember-typescript-addon-blueprint.git {your_addon_name} --yarn`

## Acknowledgements

This work is very heavily borrowed from [Ember CLI TypeScript](https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript).
